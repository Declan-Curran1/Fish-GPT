# Fish Species Classification with LLM and Image Encoder

This project trains a large language model (LLM) with an image encoder to classify fish species based on input images. The model is fine-tuned to not only identify the fish species but also provide a detailed explanation for its classification decision. You may ask why this was done instead of a normal CNN which is much faster and easier to train??? The answer is that the model also provides an explanation for why a given fish was chosen and suggests potential other species. Otherwise, a CNN would still be much faster and is probably the better option regardless. 

The fine-tuned model is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Declan1/llava-v1.6-mistral-7b-sydneyfish-a100).

## üìñ Overview

### Objectives
- Train an LLM with an image encoder to classify fish species.
- Fine-tune the model to generate explanations for its predictions.
- Use image data scraped from the internet and caption data curated from the Australian Museum and an LLM.

### Features
- **Fish Species Identification**: Predicts the fish species based on a given image.
- **Explainability**: Provides a detailed textual explanation for its predictions.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Optimized for 4 hours on an A100 GPU.
